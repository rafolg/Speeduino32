##### A personal implementation based on the awesome work done by the original Speeduino community

## Speeduino32
This project is my personal flavour of the official Speeduino project that was originally incepted by noisymime. My aim is to extract as much of the available processing power of the Teensy 4.1 board by adding the following features:

Knock per cylinder - currently enbled for 4 cyl applications but can be expanded to 8
Larger tables
All axuliary functions can run at the same time: idle, boost, vvt, wmi, pwmFan
WiFi comms

More to come

The Speeduino32 project is a flexible, fully featured Engine Management Systems (EMS aka ECU) based on the low cost and open source Teensyduino platform. It provides the hardware, firmware and software components that make up an engine management system, all provided under open licenses.
